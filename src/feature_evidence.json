This includes updating the CSS variables in `frontend/src/index.css` (e.g., `--primary`, `--ring`, and any other theme tokens currently using purple/blue hues such as chart colors and accents as appropriate), and adjusting any utility classes that hardcode blue/purple colors (e.g., the `.gradient-text` utility currently using `to-blue-600`) so the UI no longer presents as purple/blue and instead reads as green-themed while maintaining good contrast and readability.",
