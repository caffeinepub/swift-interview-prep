      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "In light mode, primary actions and accents (e.g., buttons, icons using `text-primary`, focus rings using `ring-ring`) appear green-toned rather than purple/blue.",
        "In dark mode, the primary color and focus ring are also green-toned and remain clearly visible on dark backgrounds.",
        "The `.gradient-text` utility no longer gradients to a blue color (e.g., no longer uses `to-blue-600`) and instead uses a green-compatible gradient end color.",
        "No obvious purple/blue brand accents remain in common UI surfaces (header icon background, primary buttons, links/accents, focus styles) unless intentionally kept for non-brand semantic purposes (e.g., destructive/red).",
        "Typography and contrast remain readable in both themes (no low-contrast green text on green backgrounds)."

Use shadcn-ui theming via CSS variables (tokens consumed by Tailwind color mappings) rather than editing any files under `frontend/src/components/ui`. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
