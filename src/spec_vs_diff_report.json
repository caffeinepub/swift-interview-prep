  "summary": "REQ-16 appears largely implemented via updated CSS design tokens in frontend/src/index.css (light/dark HSL variables for primary/ring/chart colors) and updating the .gradient-text utility to a green-compatible gradient. However, the diff also introduces several additional global style/utility changes not explicitly requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed multiple non-palette global style utilities (text hierarchy utilities like .text-page-title/.text-section-title/.text-card-title/.text-meta, card hover utility, generic transition utility, smooth scrolling).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is to switch the color palette and adjust hardcoded accent colors that conflict with the new theme; it explicitly lists non-goals like redesigning UI/UX. These additional utilities go beyond palette/token updates.",

      "description": "Changed focus-visible styling globally (\"Enhanced focus visibility\" applying ring classes and offset to *:focus-visible).",

      "description": "Introduced/modified code block copy button positioning styles (.prose pre padding/position, .code-copy-button positioning).",
