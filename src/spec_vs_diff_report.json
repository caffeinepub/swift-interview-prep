  "summary": "REQ-11 appears implemented by introducing a HintsPanel with an initialVisibleCount and wiring QuestionSections to reveal the first hint immediately on first expand. REQ-10 appears addressed by expanding static sample data in frontend/src/lib/data.ts, but the diff is truncated so exact verification of section/topic count fields matching actual dataset totals is not fully possible from provided evidence.",

      "description": "Added a \"X of Y visible\" badge/progress indicator within the hints controls UI.",
      "reason": "REQ-11 only specifies that the first hint should be revealed immediately and that the existing controls continue to work; it does not request adding a badge/progress indicator.",

      "description": "Added decorative icons/animations/styling changes inside the hints panel (e.g., lucide icons per button and per hint, animated fade-in, highlighted hint card styling).",
      "reason": "Not explicitly requested by REQ-10 or REQ-11; these are additional UI enhancements beyond the specified behavior change and dataset expansion.",
